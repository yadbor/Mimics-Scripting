## This version assumes that the mimcs project has already had the 
## bone mask and at least one eye defined.
## Each eye consists of a spline for the orbital border, a sphere for the globe and
## optionally a point marking the apex of the orbit.

## THe bone mask will be the last mask defined in the project.
## This allows for the basic thresholded bone mask to be refined by, for example, extractng a connected region.
  
## The spline, sphere and point for each eye are identified, based on their X coordinat.
## CT data go from -ve X on the Right to +ve X on the Left, but because the patient might be scanned
